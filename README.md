-What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
Data comes "As-Is" from many different sources. It's often messy and out of order. Algorithm aid in sorting out the data. The problem that was being solved for the projects in these courses was to understand what methods work best, both quickly and with less demand on system resources. A client wanted to be able to display their catalog of courses in a professional software application. This involved reading the data from a csv file, storing it and displaying it, as well as making it searchable. 

-How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
Each requirement was broken up into specific task, and I took three separate data structures and compared how they would handle the data.

-How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I relied on communication to the professor, W3 schools and Zybooks to help guide me code and analysis. 

-How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
I feel I am able to not just store or access data, but actually interact with it, and can let a user interact with it how they see fit. These are marketable skills.

-How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
It really sold me on the fact that you take functions/methods and break them down into chunks. You use the same logic with different data storage types just like you similarly code in other languages. Understand the requirements and take baby steps.
